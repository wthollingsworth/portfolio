Hi!  I'm Will, an intrinsically motivated software engineer and educator
comfortable solving problems independently and collaboratively with a
variety of languages and tools.  I'm passionate about educational technology
that supports students and teachers and values the impact that teachers can
have on students.

About
-----

I've been excited about computers and all of the opportunities they can create
since I was five or six years old using my grandmother's computer to play
solitaire or browse the web with Compuserve.  My excitement for education
however, was a happy accident.  I was appointed Head TA in graduate school.  As
an introvert, the idea of leading a room of twenty or so people didn't excite
me at first.  But over time I found that guiding these students through their
work was one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had, and one that has
influenced my career path.  My experiences teaching and mentoring have made me a
better collaborator and communicator.

Most of my programming experience has been with C and C++ with an object
oriented methodology, but I have also worked extensively with Java, Python,
and Javascript and am always excited to learn more.

### This Portfolio
This portfolio was created from scratch as a way to learn some web development basics, as well as play around with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language

Languages: Rust, HTML, CSS, Javascript \

### pomodoro.nvim

A plugin for the [Neovim](https://neovim.io) text editor that implements the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).
This is a work in progress but the goal is to have it follow the method
described in the book as closely as possible, including a "manual" windup of
timer, which most software implementations prefer to automate.

Languages: Lua, Vimscript \

### ziptools and zippy

While working as a computer science teacher, I needed to work with Learning
Management Systems (LMS) that usually aren't built with computer science and
programming in mind.  An LMS typically allows students and teachers to manage
assignments electronically in one place, and for teachers to grade assignments
in that same place.  Since these don't include tools to run code, I needed to
download these to another location that was suitable for grading.  This
typically took an hour per project, which was valuable time that could have
been used providing feedback to students.  Ziptools and zippy automate this
effort.

Ziptools is a set of bash scripts for working with lots of zipfiles, including
listing the archives in a directory, and extracting them in bulk to another
location.  Zippy provides a CLI that is intended for the workflow of checking
on and collecting student work.

Languages: Bash \

### texify

A Bash script to simplify generating a PDF from a LaTeX document with a BibTeX
bibliography.  This involves running multiple additional terminal commands when
compared to a LaTeX document without a bibliography.  This script simplifies
the process so that a single command is used for both cases, which also results
in a significant speedup compared to running the commands manually.

I'm currently looking for full-time software engineering work.  Most of my
experience is with C and C++, but the mission is far more important to me
than the tech stack and I love learning new programming languages and tools.
If you think I might be able to help you, please get in touch.
