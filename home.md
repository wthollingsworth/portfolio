About
-----

Discovering my passion for education was a happy accident.  In graduate school,
I was appointed Head TA, a position I was initially reluctant to fill.  As an
introvert that can be somewhat shy, the thought of being the figure of authority
guiding 20 or more students was a little scary.  But over time, I found it to be
one of the most rewarding experiences I'd had.

After an unfilfilling first attempt as a software engineer, I pivoted from
finanical technology to education as a teacher.  I'm now looking to take the
next step and combine my passions for software and education and help make a
difference for as many students as possible.

### This Portfolio
This portfolio was created from scratch as a way to learn some web development basics, as well as play around with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language

Languages: Rust, HTML, CSS, Javascript \

### pomodoro.nvim

A plugin for the [Neovim](https://neovim.io) text editor that implements the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).
This is a work in progress but the goal is to have it follow the method
described in the book as closely as possible, including a "manual" windup of
timer, which most software implementations prefer to automate.

Languages: Lua, Vimscript \

### ziptools and zippy

While working as a computer science teacher, I needed to work with Learning
Management Systems (LMS) that usually aren't built with computer science and
programming in mind.  An LMS typically allows students and teachers to manage
assignments electronically in one place, and for teachers to grade assignments
in that same place.  Since these don't include tools to run code, I needed to
download these to another location that was suitable for grading.  This
typically took an hour per project, which was valuable time that could have
been used providing feedback to students.  Ziptools and zippy automate this
effort.

Ziptools is a set of bash scripts for working with lots of zipfiles, including
listing the archives in a directory, and extracting them in bulk to another
location.  Zippy provides a CLI that is intended for the workflow of checking
on and collecting student work.

Languages: Bash \

### texify

A Bash script to simplify generating a PDF from a LaTeX document with a BibTeX
bibliography.  This involves running multiple additional terminal commands when
compared to a LaTeX document without a bibliography.  This script simplifies
the process so that a single command is used for both cases, which also results
in a significant speedup compared to running the commands manually.

I'm currently looking for full-time software engineering work.  Most of my
experience is with C and C++, but the mission is far more important to me
than the tech stack and I love learning new programming languages and tools.
