Hi!  I'm Will, a motivated software engineer and educator comfortable solving
problems independently and collaboratively with a variety of languages and
tools.  I'm passionate about educational technology that supports students and
teachers, especially those which value the impact that teachers can have on
students.

About
-----

I've been excited about computers and all of the opportunities they can create
since I was five or six years old using my grandmother's computer to play
solitaire or browse the web with Compuserve.  Later, my excitement for education
arose once I was appointed Head TA in graduate school.  The idea of leading a
room of twenty or so people didn't excite me at first, but over time I found
that guiding students through their work was one of the most rewarding
experiences I've ever had.  My experiences teaching and mentoring have served to
make me a better collaborator and communicator, and kept me familiar with
essential data structures and algorithms.  Now, I want to use my skills to help
make software that cultivates student success and equitable learning experiences,
and allows teachers to spend more time on what really matters: teaching.

Most of my programming experience has been with an object oriented methodology
in languages like C and C++, but I have also worked extensively with Java,
Python, and Javascript.  That said, I am always excited to learn more; I'm
currently working to pick up Express.JS, MongoDB + Mongoose, and Rust as well.

### This Portfolio
This portfolio was created from scratch as a way to learn some web development basics,
as well as play around with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

Languages: Rust, HTML, CSS, Javascript \

### pomodoro.nvim

A plugin for the [Neovim](https://neovim.io) text editor that implements the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).
This is a work in progress but the goal is to have it follow the method
described in the book as closely as possible, including a "manual" windup of
timer, which most software implementations prefer to automate.

Languages: Lua, Vimscript \

### ziptools and zippy

While working as a computer science teacher, I needed to work with Learning
Management Systems (LMS) that usually aren't built with computer science and
programming in mind.  An LMS typically allows students and teachers to manage
assignments electronically in one place, and for teachers to grade assignments
in that same place.  Since these don't include tools to run code, I needed to
download these to another location that was suitable for grading.  This
typically took an hour per project, which was valuable time that could have
been used providing feedback to students.  Ziptools and zippy automate this
effort.

Ziptools is a set of bash scripts for working with lots of zipfiles, including
listing the archives in a directory, and extracting them in bulk to another
location.  Zippy provides a CLI that is intended for the workflow of checking
on and collecting student work.

Languages: Bash \

### texify

A Bash script to simplify generating a PDF from a LaTeX document with a BibTeX
bibliography.  This involves running multiple additional terminal commands when
compared to a LaTeX document without a bibliography.  This script simplifies
the process so that a single command is used for both cases, which also results
in a significant speedup compared to running the commands manually.
